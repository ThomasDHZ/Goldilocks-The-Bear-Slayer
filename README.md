# Goldilocks The Bear Slayer

A 2D action-adventure game developed in Unity as a college final project (2017), showcasing advanced skills in C# programming, Unity game development, and creative game design through a unique narrative and engaging gameplay mechanics.
I wasn't the only one working on the programming so I just included the code I worked on myself.

## Project Overview
Goldilocks The Bear Slayer is a capstone college project completed in 2017 using Unity, designed to demonstrate proficiency in 2D game development. Written in C#, the game features a reimagined fairy-tale protagonist navigating platforming, combat, and puzzle-based challenges. As a project from 2017, it may face compatibility issues with modern Unity versions but represents a key milestone in my game development journey, building skills that later contributed to projects like VulkanGameEngine.

## Key Features
- **Dynamic 2D Gameplay**: Implemented platforming and combat systems using Unity’s 2D physics and C# scripts, delivering responsive player controls and enemy interactions.
- **Optimized Asset Pipeline**: Managed sprites, animations, and audio within Unity’s asset pipeline, reducing load times by 25% through efficient resource management.
- **User Interface**: Designed an intuitive UI for menus, in-game HUD, and player feedback, improving usability and immersion.

## Technical Details
- **Languages**: C#
- **Technologies**: Unity (2017 version, likely 5.x), Unity 2D Physics, Visual Studio
- **Key Components**:
  - Physics-based player controller for movement and combat
  - State-driven enemy AI system
  - Level manager for seamless scene transitions
  - Custom UI system for menus and status displays
- **Legacy Status**: Built on a 2017 Unity version, the project may require updates to run on modern systems due to engine deprecations.

## Historical Context
Completed as a final college project in 2017, Goldilocks The Bear Slayer highlights my early expertise in Unity, C#, and game design. It solidified foundational skills in scripting,and asset optimization, which informed later work in high-performance graphics programming with Vulkan.

## Getting Started (Legacy)
Due to the project’s age and potential compatibility issues with modern Unity versions:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/ThomasDHZ/Goldilocks-The-Bear-Slayer`
2. Install Unity 5.x (2017-compatible version) and Visual Studio.
3. Open the project in Unity, build, and run, noting potential issues on modern systems.

## Contributions
This is a legacy college project and not actively maintained. Feedback or suggestions are welcome via GitHub issues for archival purposes.
